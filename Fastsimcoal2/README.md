# Scripts and input files for simulating demographical events of Vatica guangxiensis


The three folders contain input files for three different SCENARIONAME respectively.

## Initial simulations of 50 runs

Each demographic model are provided the files necessary to run the parameters estimate with the command (for batch submission to HPC, please refer to "Initial_simulations_50.sh"):

```
fsc -c 12 -t xxx.tpl -n500000 -m -e xxx.est -M -L50 -q --multiSFS --foldedSFS
```

xxx.tpl (i.e. template file for the tested model xxx)
xxx.est (i.e. a file where the distributions of the parameters described in the .tpl are fully specified)
xxx_jointMAFpopX_Y.obs (i.e. the 2D-SFS of a pair of populations [X and Y] included in the model xxx)

After the simulations, perform "bestrun.sh" to extract the best run for each demographic model into a new folder named "bestrun".

Run "AIC.R" to calculate AIC value for the bestrun of each demographic model. Compare the AIC values among models to determine the best model.

## Parametric bootstrapping 

Once the best demographic model is determined, modify the "xxx_maxL.par" in the subfolder "bestrun" of the folder of the best demographic model.

xxx_maxL.par (i.e. the .par file where the estimated parameters have been replaced by their ML values for the model xxx)

Modify the "xxx_maxL.par" to create "xxx_boot.par" by replacing "FREQ" with "DNA" for data type and corresponding change in the number of loci to simulate.

Use the "xxx_boot.par" as input to simulate 100 SFS with the command (for batch submission to HPC, please refer to "SFS_bootstrapping_100.sh"):

```
fsc -c 12 -i xxx_boot.par -n100 -j -m -s0 -x â€“I -q --foldedSFS
```

This will create 100 folders. For each folder, run the parameter estimate with "Bootstrapping_simulations.sh" and then "CI.R" to get confidence intervals for the estimated demographic parameters.
